<h3> How Gaming Changed from  </h3>

<p> In 2010 the launch of software that makes gaming more accessible and portable came to the forefront,
such as the Nintendo Switch console and the introduction of live-streaming platforms like Twitch and Microsoft's Mixer, as well as gaming subscriptions like Apple Arcade and Xbox Game Pass becoming the norm.
The swift rise of professional streamers in the esports industry. Many video games were discovered from 2010-2020 such as Minecraft, Fruit Ninja, Skylanders, Fortnite, Among Us, Clash of Clans, World of Tanks, and etc. </p>

<h3> Gaming Subscriptions </h3>

<p> Xbox Game Pass, Apple Arcade, Google Stadia, Playstation Now, Twitch Prime and EA Access are just a handful of gaming subscriptions currently on offer, and the last couple of years have seen a steep increase in options. In reference to the cloud gaming service Stadia, Jack Buser, director of games at Google, told THR, "This is where you’ll see the next big jump in what games can be. You’ll never download a game or have to download an update. We’re already used to this in movies and TV, we just haven’t seen it in games yet. It’s tough to go back to console." With a roster of games across all genres, styles and aesthetics on each subscription platform, the idea of a 'Netflix for Gaming' model has arrived. </p>

<h3> Mobile Gaming </h3>

<p> While mobile games have been around since the early Nokia cellphones (Snake, anyone?), they really came into focus with the widespread availability of Wi-Fi in 2002 and the iOs App Store launch in 2007. The defining moment in the last decade for mobile games is the in-app purchase functionality introduced by Apple in 2009. Since then, mobile games have risen to meteoric proportions. Niantic Inc.'s location-based AR mobile game Pokemon Go hit $3 billion in lifetime revenue this year. Tencent Games' multiplayer PUBG Mobile passed 100 million downloads in the first four months of its life on App Store and Google Play. Mario Kart Tour scored Nintendo's biggest first-month mobile launch with 129.3 downloads in the first 30 days of release, generating over $37.4 million in player spending since September. That was toppled by Call of Duty Mobile, which gained 148 million downloads in its first month to become the second-most-successful mobile launch of all time. These are just a few of the titles and figures responsible for the market's steady rise of late, hitting its highest single-day record of $69.7 million in the U.S. on Black Friday last month —  the majority of revenue generated by the App store. Mobile games now make up 59 percent of the digital game market share. In October, video game company Zynga posted record revenue figures fueled by on-the-go content, with $328 million from its mobile games division, amounting to 95 percent of the company's total revenue.
