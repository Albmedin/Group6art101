    <p>Arcade games were a thriving business in the early 1980s. In 1981, the arcade video game business in the United States alone generated $5 billion in sales, and the number of arcades quadrupled between 1980 and 1982.  The impact of video games on society spread to other mediums including blockbuster films and music.</p>

    <h2>AN ICON BASED ON PIZZA</h2>
    <p>In 1981, Pac-Man was released in arcades. One of the objectives of its creator was to make a game that appealed to women. At the time, most arcade machines were based off of war and appealed more to men. The creators made the theme instead about eating and made the character, based off of a pizza missing a slice, cute. </p>

		<h2>FROM POPEYE TO DONKEY KONG</h2>
		<p>Nintendo was a company that for lack of a better word, had an identity crisis. It went through many phases of different types of products, from card games to restaurants.</p>

    <h2>CRASH OF ‘83</h2>
    <p>Several computer and console companies had gone bankrupt (Atari reported a $536 million loss in 1983. Some industry insiders and investors lost faith in the overall market of video games, believing it to be a transitory fad. E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, based off of the 1982 Steven Speilburg feature film, was a game that was such a critical and financial flop that remaining unsold cartridges were buried in the deserts of New Mexico.</p>

    <h2>HOME COMPUTERS</h2>
    <p>While the console market was crashing and burning, the home computers market was thriving even more during this era. The Commodore 64 is an 8-bit home computer released by Commodore International in January 1982. It was initially demonstrated at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on January 7–10, 1982. The C64 could provide stronger images and audio than systems without such bespoke hardware, thanks to support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform creation.  </p>

    <p>Sinclair Research created the ZX Spectrum, an 8-bit personal computer. It was initially introduced in the United Kingdom on April 23, 1982, and quickly became the best-selling microcomputer in the country.The Spectrum was available in eight distinct variants, ranging from the entry-level 16 KB RAM model introduced in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum +3 model released in 1987 with 128 KB RAM and a built-in floppy disk drive. All these new devices coming to fruition motivated people to develop their own games from home. All these new devices coming to fruition motivated people to develop their own games from home</p>

    <h2>UNIVERSAL VS NINTENDO</h2>

    <h2>NINTENDO STRIKES</h2>
    <p>The Nintendo Entertainment System was just about ready to be sold to the public, but how would they get the attention of an audience that had turned their back on video games since 1983’s video game crash. The answer was a toy Robot dubbed the Robotic Operating Buddy (R.O.B.) in America. This along with other peripherals like the Nintendo Zapper that was compatible with games like Duck Hunt gave the impression to consumers that Nintendo’s products weren’t games but toys.</p>
